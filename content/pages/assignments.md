Students are required to complete two papers and an oral presentation.

Paper 1
-------

Students should write 5-7 pages on a topic related to the material covered in the course. Consultation with the course instructor is strongly encouraged. The goal of Paper 1 is to allow the student to delve deeper into a particular aspect of the Brownfield issue.

Paper 2
-------

Students should write 10-12 pages that build on the topic chosen for the first paper using in-class learning. Paper 2, and the associated oral presentation, will examine going-forward implications of that topic.

Student Work
------------

Five students in the course worked together on a final project, a survey tool and recommendations that served the needs of a real client, the Economic Development and Industrial Corporation of Lynn, MA. The report is presented below. All work is courtesy of the students named and used with permission.
